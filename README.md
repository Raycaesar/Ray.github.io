 This project centered around the principles of Social Announcement Logic (SAL). It serves as an introduction to SAL, detailing the denotation of formulas and providing a visual representation of an SAL model.
The Model Generator is done on 13//11/2023. Now we can verify free announcement formulas.
The Tableau Generator is done on 10/12/2023. Now we can generate tableau proof and models for formulas of arbitrary social announcement logic (ASAL).
The Announceable Test is a program to show the core of my proof for the soundness box-arbitrary elimination rule. Now the model changing part is done on 23/12/2023. The next move will focus on how the satisfiability of arbitrary formulas are preserved during model changing. Merry Christmas!
