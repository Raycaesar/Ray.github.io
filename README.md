 This project centered around the principles of Social Announcement Logic (SAL). It serves as an introduction to SAL, detailing the denotation of formulas and providing a visual representation of an SAL model.
The Model Generator is done on 13//11/2023. Now we can verify free announcement formulas.

The Tableau Generator is done on 10/12/2023. Now we can generate tableau proof and models for formulas of arbitrary social announcement logic (ASAL).

The Announceable Test is a program to show the core of my proof for the soundness box-arbitrary elimination rule. Now the model changing part is done on 23/12/2023. The next move will focus on how the satisfiability of arbitrary formulas are preserved during model changing. 

The Announceable Test is done on 24/12/2023/ Now we can demonstrate how model changing preserve arbitrary formulas!  Merry Christmas!

To show this framewrok can deal with many-valued logic. I add m_value on 5/1/2024/ This shows how denotation will look like if we select three values in semantics. I choose the oldest LP, logic of paradox where there is no implication.

According to my supervisor's suggestion. I add a social graph which can show the following relationship and the strongest belief each agent hold together. To simplify the belief expression, I employ the technique from K-map so I made a program to generate sop(sum of product). Currently both social graph and k-map only support 3 variables. There is some minor issue about social graph as well but they can work. 12/5/2024/

Now I add the Coherences pragram into this project. In my thesis, I defined five coherences. This program will show what are they and will help us to check which coherence our designed model belongs to. 
Besides, I uploaded a slide about main parts of my thesis. 21/5/2024/

Based on a logic in Chapter 5 in my thesis, I write a program to show how to simulate an echo chamber including its formation and collapse. This is an applicable tool which can help us do network analysis with epistemic distribution.  07/6/2024/
